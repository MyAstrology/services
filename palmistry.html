    <p>
      From birth, human beings walk the path in search of purpose and destiny — sometimes in the stars of the sky, sometimes in the prayers of temples, and sometimes in the winding, zigzag lines of the palm.  
      Some dismiss it as superstition, while others believe it holds the keys to their past, present, and future.
    </p>

    <p>
      But the question remains — is palmistry truly the mirror of fate, or just intricate folds of skin?  
      To find the answer, we must stand on three pillars — <strong>Ancient Scriptures</strong>, <strong>Spiritual Philosophy</strong>, and <strong>Modern Science</strong>.
    </p>

    <p>
      The <em>Bhrigu Samhita</em> and <em>Varahi Samhita</em> describe palm lines as an accurate method of determining planetary influences.  
      The <em>Patanjali Yoga Sutras</em> and <em>Upanishads</em> teach that the journey to self-knowledge begins with understanding one’s own body and consciousness.  
      On the scientific side, research by <em>Penfield</em>, <em>Sperry</em>, and <em>Ramachandran</em> has shown a direct neurological link between the hands and the brain, influencing our emotions, thoughts, and decisions.
    </p>

    <p>
      This is why palmistry is not merely fortune telling —  
      it is a <strong>classical, spiritual, and evidence-based exploration</strong> that offers deeper self-understanding and helps guide future possibilities in the right direction.
